Yes, I think it’s a good idea to prioritize fixing the **502 Bad Gateway error** before continuing with the additional component work. This error typically indicates that the **server** (in your case, the Express backend) is **not properly communicating with the frontend**, and the issue might stem from misconfigurations in how the frontend and backend are set up or how they are being routed.

### Here’s a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot the **502 Bad Gateway error**:

---

### 1. **Check the Backend Server (Express)**
   - **Ensure the backend is running**: Verify that your Express server is up and running. If you're using a **Node.js server**, you can check the logs or run:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
     Make sure the backend is running on the correct port, typically **5000** (or another port if you configured it differently).
   - **Check API routes**: Ensure that your API routes are correctly set up and that they return the expected responses when hit. Use tools like **Postman** or **cURL** to test API endpoints directly.

### 2. **Check React Frontend Configuration**
   - **API URL connection**: If your frontend is trying to access the backend, ensure that the **API URL** is correctly set up in your frontend code. For example, if the backend is running on `http://localhost:5000`, make sure all the **API calls** in the React app use this URL.
     ```ts
     const API_URL = 'http://localhost:5000'; // Make sure this is correct
     ```
   - **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: If you have different origins (e.g., backend on port 5000, frontend on port 3000 during development), make sure that your **CORS configuration** allows requests from the frontend. In your Express app, you can enable CORS:
     ```js
     const cors = require('cors');
     app.use(cors());
     ```

### 3. **Check NGINX Configuration (if deployed)**
   - **NGINX reverse proxy**: If you’re deploying to a VPS with **NGINX**, make sure the **reverse proxy** configuration is set up correctly to forward requests to the backend. Your NGINX configuration might look like:
     ```nginx
     server {
         listen 80;
         server_name yourdomain.com;

         location / {
             proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
             proxy_http_version 1.1;
             proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
             proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
             proxy_set_header Host $host;
             proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
         }
     }
     ```

### 4. **Check for Dependency Issues**
   - Since you’ve been adding the **BI dashboard** and updating component dependencies, it’s worth checking if there are any **broken dependencies** that might be affecting the connection. Run:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     yarn install
     ```
   - **Check for errors in the browser console**: If the frontend still isn’t displaying correctly, open the browser console to look for any JavaScript errors related to network requests.

### 5. **Check Logs**
   - **Express logs**: Check the Express server logs for any errors related to incoming requests or connection failures. If you're using `npm`, you can view the logs with:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - **NGINX logs**: If deploying to a VPS with NGINX, check the NGINX logs to see if requests are getting blocked or misrouted:
     ```bash
     sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
     ```

### Suggested Next Steps:
1. **Confirm that the backend is up** by checking the Express server.
2. **Verify the API URL** in the React app to ensure it’s correctly pointed at the backend server.
3. **Check NGINX reverse proxy** settings if deployed on a VPS, making sure traffic is properly forwarded to your Express server.
4. **Ensure that dependencies are correct**, especially after adding new components.
5. **Look at logs** on both the backend (Express) and server (NGINX) for any relevant error messages.

Once the 502 issue is resolved, you can continue with adding new components to the BI Dashboard module.
